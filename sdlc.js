// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisOfRequirements = "Identifiying the dependencies that will be worked with and making sure your coding environment is prepared"

const design ="Laying out the pieces and structuring them all to get the build out"

const implementation ="Putting the prep work into practice and start coding"

const testingAndIntegration = "Making sure the application is working correctly, is user friendly, and everything is implemented"

const maintain = "Users discover bugs that weren't found in testing and resolving errors"
